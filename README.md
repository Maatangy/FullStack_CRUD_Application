# FullStack_CRUD_Application
This project is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend provides RESTful APIs for managing `Course` resources, while the frontend allows users to interact with the system via a web interface.
